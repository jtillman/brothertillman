                                        My name is <b>Jeremy Tillman</b>. My goal is to affect a positive change on the quality of life for all people (<a href="http://www.nsbe.org/About-Us/NSBE-Torch-Symbol.aspx" target="_blank">The NSBE Torch</a>).
                                        Having a B.S. in Computer Engineering (<a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE" target="_blank">Boiler Up!</a>),
                                        I spend most of my time trying to affect change within products
                                        and people in the software engineering realm.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    Typically, I spend time working on the most painful/troublesome parts of products. The places where we have become content with tedious, time-intensive tasks that cause product or customer errors.
                                    I seek the pleasure of fixing problems at their fundemental level, which reliefs the stress of corner case bugs creeping into our daily lives. While this helps other developers focus more of their time on their customer, it makes these same developers my primary customer.
                                </p>
